Over the next two weeks youâ€™ll create ETHOS, the Electronic Temperature & Humidity Observation System. ETHOS will gather temperature and relative humidity information from an Si7021 I2C-based temperature-humidity sensor and continuously display the results on an I2C-based 1602A 16x2 LCD display. Also, ETHOS will provide temperature and humidity information to remote users interactively via RS232. Designing and building ETHOS will give you an understanding of the I2C protocol and how to interface I2C devices with the Huzzah32 microcontroller.

There is a "Find_I2C_Adresses" included in your starter code.  If you are struggling to find what I2C address your devices have, this might be helpful.

Enjoy!
